        <p>From programming languages to testing and automation, it's all available on EdYoda â€” a platform started by Arman Ahmed and his friends Awantik Das and Nalinee Choudhary in 2016. Having worked in the IT industry for a considerable amount of time, the trio believed that it was time to help other youngsters like them learn the essential skills required in the industry. Arman says, "Initially, we partnered with various MNCs for upskilling and reskilling employees. I observed that these employees were spending a lot of money in reskilling themselves either through classes or the internet. Some college goers would get hooked on to YouTube to learn programming languages. It was obvious that they needed a guide or mentor to help reskill or upskill themselves. This is what led us to start EdYoda."

            What's great about this digital platform is that experts in software languages can send their content to EdYoda either in the form of a video or script. "We have made it like a community platform where we have educators from Russia, the UK and different parts of the world contributing. Once they send us the content, we curate it and it goes live. Our team checks if the content is relevant to the technology and if these skills will be relevant in the industry. Once it gets approved, we upload it," explains Arman, adding, "With a wide range of content and more than 100 videos available on the website, students can access it whenever they want to. Apart from this, the experts are also available to clear all their doubts at any point in time. We've also been getting emails from countries like Brazil and Bangladesh to make this content accessible to them as well."</p>
